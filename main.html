The short form, "blog", was coined by Peter Merholz, who jokingly broke the word weblog into the phrase we blog in the sidebar of his blog Peterme.com in April or May 1999.[14][15][16] Shortly thereafter, Evan Williams at Pyra Labs used "blog" as both a noun and verb ("to blog", meaning "to edit one''s weblog or to post to one''s weblog") and devised the term "blogger" in connection with Pyra Labs" Blogger product, leading to the popularization of the terms.[17]</p>
